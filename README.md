# Text Editor Application

## Flesch Readability Score

Measure the reading complexity of the text in the editor using the Flesch
Readability Score.  The Flesch Readability Score was developed by author Rudolf
Flesch and it approximates how easy a piece of text is to read based on the
number of sentences, words and syllables in that text.  Higher scores indicate
text that is simple to read, while lower scores indicate more complex text.
